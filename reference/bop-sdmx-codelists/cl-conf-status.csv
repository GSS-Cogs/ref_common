Free (free for publication),F,,1,"Used for observations without any special sensitivity considerations and which can thus be freely shared. Usually, source organisations provide information and guidance on general requirements for re-dissemination  (like mentioning the source) either on their websites or in their paper publications. In some institutional environments the term ""unclassified"" is used in a sense that still denotes implied restrictions in the circulation of information. If this is the case, the organisations concerned may probably consider that ""free"" (value F) is not the appropriate tag for this kind of ""unclassified"" category and that ""Not for publication, restricted for internal use only"" (value N) may be more appropriate."
"Not for publication, restricted for internal use only",N,,2,Used to denote observations that are restricted for internal use only within organisations. This code may be accompanied with an additional observation-level attribute: CONF_REDIST which defines the secondary recipient(s) to whom the sender allows the primary recipient to forward confidential data.
Confidential statistical information,C,,3,"Confidential statistical information (primary confidentiality) due to identifiable respondents. Measures also should be taken to prevent not only direct access, but also indirect deduction or calculation by other users and parties, probably by considering and treating additional observations as ""confidential"" (secondary confidentiality management)."
"Secondary confidentiality set by the sender, not for publication",D,,4,"Used by the sender of the data to flag (beyond the confidential statistical information) additional observations in the dataset so that the receiver knows that he/she should suppress these observations in subsequent stages of processing (especially dissemination) in order to prevent third parties to indirectly deduct the observations that are genuinely flagged with ""C""."
"Secondary confidentiality set and managed by the receiver, not for publication",S,,5,"If senders do not manage the secondary confidentiality in their data and/or there are also other countries' data involved (with the intention to eventually compile a regional-wide aggregate that is going to be published), the value ""S"" is used by the receiver to flag additional suppressed observations (within sender's data and/or within the datasets of other senders) in subsequent stages of processing (especially, dissemination) in order to prevent third parties to indirectly deduct the observations that were genuinely flagged with ""C"" by the sender."
Primary confidentiality due to small counts,A,,6,"A cell is flagged as confidential if less than m units (""too few units"") contribute to the total of that cell. The limits of what constitutes ""small counts"" can vary across statistical domains, countries, etc."
Primary confidentiality due to dominance by one unit,O,,7,"Used when one unit accounts for more than x % of the total of a cell. The value of x can vary across statistical domains or countries, be influenced by legislation, etc."
Primary confidentiality due to dominance by two units,T,,8,"Used when two units account for more than x % of the total of a cell. The value of x can vary across statistical domains or countries, be influenced by legislation, etc."
Primary confidentiality due to dominance by one or two units,G,,9,"Used when one or two units account(s) for more than x % of the total of a cell. The value of x can vary across statistical domains or countries, be influenced by legislation, etc."
Primary confidentiality due to data declared confidential based on other measures of concentration,M,,10,"Cells declared confidential using mathematical definitions of sensitive cells, e.g. p-percent, p/q or (n,k) rules."
"Not for publication, restricted for internal use only (equivalent to the code N) until the embargo time elapses; Free for publication (equivalent to the code F) after the embargo time elapses.",E,,11,Used for embargoed data. The embargo time has to be specified in the EMBARGO_TIME attribute. This code may be accompanied with an additional observation-level attribute: CONF_REDIST which defines the secondary recipient(s) to whom the sender allows the primary recipient to forward confidential data.
